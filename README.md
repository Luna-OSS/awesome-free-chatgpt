I had to change some wordings to avoid [trademark violations](https://techstartups.com/2023/05/04/openai-send-cease-owner-of-sitegpt-ai-forced-to-rebrand/)... Sorry about that!

The following table contains several unofficial websites for using "Closed"AI's Chat*** without an account or an API key for free. The following chat models can be used (depends on site):

- `***-3.5-turbo` (allows max. 4,096 input tokens)
- `***-4` (allows max. 8,192 input tokens)
- `***-4-32k` (allows max. 32,768 input tokens)

## Working Chat*** proxy/mirror websites (no account/API key required)

All of them respond in English, too (even if the website itself is in Chinese).

The table only represents the features of the free version of the website. Some websites offer a paid version with more features.

Make sure to read the text under the table, as well, as it contains important information about the websites.


**The API column is coming soon.**

\*"***-4" support needs more testing to confirm. Feel free to contribute by creating a pull request and explaining how you tested it.

**English**: has an (mostly at least) English version of the website available. On Chanzhaoyu dashboards, you can set the language in `Settings` -> `Language`.

**GUI**: User interface the website uses

**Custom Sys. Prompt**: Allows you to set a custom system prompt, sometimes called "role". On chat.zuhlei.xyz, you can open the settings menu and set `系统角色指令` (the fourth option) to your desired value. On omg.ck9.us, set 角色 in the top bar to your desired system prompt.

⚙️ means that the website already set a custom system prompt (for example, it doesn't say it's Chat***, but says the website's name) and it's not possible to change it.

**Custom Temp.** - Allows you to customize the temperature
